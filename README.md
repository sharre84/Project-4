### Approach taken

1. I started by drawing out our Wireframes to a diagram and to plan my project.
2. After that, I made a planning board and wrote user stories using Trello.
3. I created models, views, and controllers for this app. Full CRUD was achieved using RESTful routing.
4. Lastly, after all the debugging, the app was deployed to Heroku.


### Future Implementations

* The ability to track future maintenance that is due
* The ability to have a more detailed list of vehicles
